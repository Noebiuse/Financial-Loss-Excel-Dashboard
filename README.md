## Main Features

### 1. Simple Filtering
Users can filter the data with **Slicers** by material and time period. This makes it easy to see which materials create the highest losses.

### 2. Clear Financial View
The dashboard shows Financial Loss by Month and the number of days with delays. This helps connect daily operational issues (delays) to their financial impact.

### 3. Basic What If Analysis
The file includes a small **What If tool**. Managers can enter a percentage of expected loss reduction and see the **projected savings**. This supports strategic planning and goal setting.

### 4. File Structure and Data Handling
The dashboard includes **protected sheets** and hidden raw data to keep formulas and source information safe.
